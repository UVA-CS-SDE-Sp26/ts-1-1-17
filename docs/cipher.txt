deciphers ciphered text using a substitution key loaded from a key file.

default key file is stored in (ciphers/key.txt)
The program may also be run with an alternate key file path as the 2nd argument:
  java topsecret <fileNumber> <keyFile>

file format -
Line 1: actual character set
Line 2: cipher character set (encoded text)

checks:
The two lines must have the same length.
Each character position defines a mapping.



mapping direction (deciphering)
To decipher, we build a mapping from:
  cipherChar -> actualChar

If cipher line has 'b' at index i and actual line has 'a' at index i,
then 'b' in the ciphered text becomes 'a' in the output.

Given input text:
- For each character in the text:
  - If the character exists in the cipher->actual map, replace it with its mapped value
  - Otherwise (spaces, punctuation, etc.), leave it unchanged
- Return the resulting string

validation/error handling
- If the file does not have exactly two lines, it is invalid
- If either line is empty, it is invalid
- If the two lines are different lengths, it is invalid
throw IllegalArgumentException
if file cannot be read, throws IOException.

Unit Tests (!!!)
- Valid key file loads and produces expected mappings
- Invalid key format (missing line, empty, different lengths) throws exception
- Deciphering replaces mapped characters correctly
- Characters not in mapping remain unchanged (try punctuations)
