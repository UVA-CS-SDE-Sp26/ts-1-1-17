The FileHandler class interfaces with the expected data folder at the root.

Tests:
data docs -- QuickBrown.txt, TJQuote.txt, ObjectOriented.txt

1. does the list of files prints successfully after using the "listFiles" FileHandler method?
INPUT  -- FileHandler.listFiles()
OUTPUT -- ["01 QuickBrown.txt", "02 TJQuote.txt", "ObjectOriented.txt"]

2. Provided a file from data, does the "readFile" method successfully parse content from that file?
INPUT  -- FileHandler.readFile("ObjectOriented.txt")
OUTPUT -- "Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California."

3. Provided a file that is not within data, does the "readFile" method throw an exception?
INPUT  -- FileHandler.readFile("Angiogenesis.txt")
OUTPUT -- FileNotFoundException
