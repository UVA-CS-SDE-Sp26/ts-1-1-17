The program controller task connects the command line interface with the file handler
to request file contents and display readable text.

Tests:
src docs -- QuickBrown.txt, TJQuote.txt, ObjectOriented.txt

1. If no args are passed, do these files in source print out as a list?
    * Have an array of strings with the number, title
    * Assert string equal for elements of the array

2. If the user passes 01 in the commandline, does the corresponding text file display?
    * Have a string with the contents of QuickBrown.txt for comparison
    * Assert if the string output is equal to the stored comparison output
